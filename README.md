### README

In this repository, I update my process of learning to write my own operating system in C++ following the tutorials.

I basically followed the instructions on this website <http://wyoos.org/index.php>, you can also find potal to videos on youtube in this site. However, I also made some changes to customize some of my own styles and wrote some conmment while studying(One reason for this is some of the old libraries used in the tutorial is no longer supported, so I have to figure an alternative to run my OS ;D).
